For the individual contribution criteria, each group member should write a file describing their contribution, learning experience and reflection. The file should describe briefly but clearly the parts you work alone or together with other members, the process of project development you follow and what did you learn from it. Reflect on the experience, eg what work well, and what could be improved.  

Aim of project
Our project aimed to develop a version of the board game Monopoly, specifically following rules for a Short Game, that is playable in a Linux system. The game will be run via local multiplayer (2-4 players) and will utilise a graphical user interface (gui) representing the game board which dynamically updates based on the current playerâ€™s actions. 

Contributions and relevant reflections
Throughout the project, I mostly focused on the spaces. I came up with the initial logic for most of the spaces, though most of this was changed in later iterations of the project. For example, in the initial Space abstract class, I only had a function to get the name of the space and a pure virtual function that I intended to control behaviour of when a player lands on the space. In future iterations, the land function was left mostly unused due to complications with rendering. Other members of the group also added more functions relating to the information of the space, and additional utility functions. I wrote the initial logic for all derived Space classes except for Jail and GoToJail (i.e. FreeParking, Go, Property, Railroad, Tax, Utility). I also helped to complete the game board in the Game class, and added about 3/4 of the game board's spaces alongside relevant information, such as space name, or cost to buy an ownable space. In hindsight, I feel like we should have planned more in regards to how we wanted a space to be used throughout the main gameplay loop. 

I also contributed to the player class, where I came up with a lot of the initial functionality, most of which was kept through later iterations of the project. For example, I wrote the functions for buying properties, railroads and utilities, functions for clearing the list of owned properties, railroads and utilities, a few basic getters and setters, and functions to add and subtract a player's money. Other members of the group also contributed to this class, specifically in regards to the player's interaction with the game board, however I feel I contributed quite significantly in this class. In general, I am quite happy that most of the base functionality I implemented in this class stayed through to the end of our project. 

Unrelated to coding, I wrote and formatted most of the README file, contributing to instructions on how to compile and run the game, and writing the game rules for the project (since we did not completely follow the rules for a short game of Monopoly). I think writing the rules we ended up going by helped clarify what we succeeded at and what we had to exclude to complete a working prototype. I also took notes whenever we had meetings, regarding plans and what we would like to get done from what we discussed. I like to think this helped us clarify what our goals from then to our next meeting were. This also allowed us to keep a record of what we discussed which I personally found helpful to reference while working on the project.
